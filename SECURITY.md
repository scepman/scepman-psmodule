# Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have discovered a security issue in the SCEPman PowerShell module or any other part of SCEPman, please [contact the SCEPman support](https://support.scepman.com/support/tickets/new?ticket_form=technical_support_request_%28scepman%29) and describe your findings.

If you find security bugs in third-party modules that SCEPman uses, for example Azure resources or Microsoft Intune, you can also contact our support. In these cases, we'll try to find ways how SCEPman can work around the security issues until the original vendor has fixed the issue. Note that you should also contact the original vendor in this case to allow them to fix this issue.
